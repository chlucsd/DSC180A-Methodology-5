## Quarter 2 Project Proposal 

**What is the most interesting topic covered in your domain this quarter?**  
The most interesting topic covered so far would be the creation of unique GUIs for use in neuron intepretability models. These interfaces allow for better human analysis of previously black box neural networks.

**Describe a potential investigation you would like to pursue for your Quarter 2 Project.**  
I would like to investigate the potential for an improved workflow as well as creating my own interface for intepreting computer vision neuron activations. We would try to implement other modern methods into the already presented domain experiments 

**What is a potential change youâ€™d make to the approach taken in your current Quarter 1 Project?**  
I would change my approach from building on previously explored methodology to creating my own code for the project. Using what I learned from my Quarter 1 project, I would build my own neuron interpretability model.

**What other techniques would you be interested in using in your project?**  
I would like to implement an interactable visualization of the model output. In other words, I would like to explore using graphical representations for explaining my project. I would also like to experiment with data engineering for the model data.
